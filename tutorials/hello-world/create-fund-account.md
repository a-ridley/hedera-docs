  Hello World sequence: Create a new account on Hedera Testnet, and fund it. Do
  this before any of the other Hello World sequences.

# Create and fund account

## Why you need to create and fund an account

Hedera is a distributed ledger technology (DLT). To interact with it, you will need to send transactions to the network, which will then process them and add them to the ledger if they are deemed to be valid. On most web services (web2), you need to authenticate using usernames and passwords to operate your account. On DLTs such as Hedera, it is similar, except that you will need to use cryptographic keys instead of passwords to operate your account. One key difference is that unlike web2, each interaction needs to be paid for using the native currency of the DLT, which is similar to microtransactions. On Hedera, this currency is HBAR.&#x20;

### What you will accomplish

* [ ] Create an account on Hedera Testnet
* [ ] Fund this new account with Testnet HBAR

***

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should be familiar with the following:

<summary>Check your prerequisites set up <strong>â¬‡</strong></summary>

Open your terminal, and enter the following commands.

```shell
bash --version
zsh --version
git --version
code --version
node --version
npm --version
```

Each of these commands should output some text that includes a version number, for example:

```
bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (arm64-apple-darwin22)
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

zsh --version
zsh 5.9 (x86_64-apple-darwin22.0)

git --version
git version 2.39.2 (Apple Git-143)

code --version
1.81.1
6c3e3dba23e8fadc360aed75ce363ba185c49794
arm64

node --version
v20.6.1

npm --version
9.8.1

```

If the output contains text similar to `command not found`, please install that item.

If the version number that is output is **lower** than the required versions, please re-install or update that item.

If the version number that is output is **same or higher** than the required versions, you have met the prequisites! ðŸŽ‰

## Get started: Set up project

To follow along, start with the `main` branch, which is the _default branch_ of this repo. This gives you the initial state from which you can follow along with the steps as described in the tutorial.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world.git
```

<details>

<summary>Alternative with `git` and SSH</summary>

If you have [configured SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to work with `git`, you may wish use this command instead:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hedera-dev/hello-future-world.git
```

</details>

In the terminal, from the `hello-future-world` directory, enter the subdirectory for this sequence.

```shell
cd 00-create-fund-account/
```

Install the dependencies using `npm`.

```shell
npm install
```

### Create your .env file

Make a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.sample` file. Then open the `.env` file in a code editor, such as VS Code.&#x20;

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

### Create account

If you already have an account on the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com), you may skip the following steps.

<details>

<summary>Set up a Hedera Portal account â¬‡</summary>

1. Visit the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com) and create a Testnet account.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/hello-world--account--portal-01-create-account.png" alt="" data-size="original">

2. Check your email for a confirmation code. Copy and paste this confirmation code to verify your Hedera portal account.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hello-world--account--portal-02-email-verification.png)

3. Fill out this form.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hello-world--account--portal-03-profile-form.png)

4. In the top-left, select Hedera Testnet from the drop-down.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hello-world--account--portal-04-select-network.png)

</details>

Once your portal testnet account is created, copy the Hedera Testnet **Account ID** and **HEX-encoded private key** from your [Hedera portal](https://portal.hedera.com/) dashboard (see screenshot below) and assign them to the `MY_ACCOUNT_ID` and `MY_PRIVATE_KEY` variables in your `.env` file:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/hello-world--account--portal-05-copy-fields.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For example, if your **Account ID** is `0.0.123`, and your **HEX-encoded private key** is `0xabcd1234`, your `.env` file should look like this:

{% code title=".env" %}
```
ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.123
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabcd1234
```
{% endcode %}

_**ðŸŽ‰ Now you are ready to start using your Hedera Testnet account from the portal within script files on your computer! Be sure to save your files before moving on to the next step.**_&#x20;

***

## Write the script

An almost complete script has already been prepared for you, and you will only need to make a few modifications (outlined below) for it to run successfully.

Then open the script file, `script-create-fund-account.js`, in a code editor.

### Step 1: Initialize the account using `Client`

Initialize the `client` instance by invoking the `setOperator` method, and passing in `accountId` and `accountKey` as parameter.

```javascript
    const client = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(accountId, accountKey);
```

Now the `client` instance represents and operates your account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Look for a comment in the code to locate the specific lines of code that you will need to edit. For example, for this step, look for this:

```javascript
    // Step (1) in the accompanying tutorial
```

You will need to delete the inline comment that looks like this: `/* ... */`. Replace it with the correct code. For example, in this step, insert this:

```javascript
accountId, accountKey
```
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Obtain the balance of the account

Use the `AccountBalanceQuery` method to obtain the Testnet HBAR balance of your account.

```javascript
    const accountBalance = await new AccountBalanceQuery()
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to check that the line of code matches the above exactly. It is easy to miss the `await` when copy-pasting!
{% endhint %}

_**Note**: The return value is an object and needs to be parsed._

### Step 3: Convert the balance result object to HBARs

Parse that return value to extract its Testnet HBAR balance so that you may convert it into a string for display purposes.

```javascript
    const accountBalanceHbars = accountBalance.hbars.toBigNumber();
```

***

## Run the script

In the terminal, run the script using the following command:

```shell
node script-create-fund-account.js
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
accountId: 0.0.1201
accountBalanceTinybars: 10,000.00000000
accountExplorerUrl: https://hashscan.io/testnet/account/0.0.1201
```

Open `accountExplorerUrl` in your browser and check that:

* The account exists, and its "account ID" should match `accountId`.
* The "balances" should match `accountBalanceTinybars`.

## Complete

Congratulations, you have completed the **create and fund account** Hello World sequence! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

You have learned how to:

* [x] Create an account on Hedera Testnet
* [x] Fund this new account with Testnet HBAR

***

## Next Steps

Now that you have an account on Hedera Testnet and it is funded, you can interact with the Hedera network. Continue by following along with [the other Hello World sequences](./).

## Cheat sheet

<details>

<summary>Skip to final state</summary>

The repo, [`github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/), is intended to be used alongside this tutorial.

To skip ahead to the final state, use the `completed` branch. This gives you the final state with which you can compare your implementation to the completed steps of the tutorial.

```shell
git fetch origin completed:completed
git checkout completed
```

To see the full set of differences between the initial and final states of the repo, you can use `diff`.

```shell
cd 00-create-fund-account/
git diff main..completed -- ./
```

Alternatively, you may view the `diff` rendered on Github: [`hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed) (This will show the `diff` for _all_ sequences.)

Note that the branch names are delimited by `..`, and not by `...`, as the latter finds the `diff` with the latest common ancestor commit, which _is not_ what we want in this case.
